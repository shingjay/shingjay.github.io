<h1>2021 work retrospective</h1>

<div class=content>
<p>At the end of the year, people typically list down their New Year’s resolutions in anticipation for the new year ahead. On the other hand, I prefer looking back at the things I’ve done over the past year. I enjoy using that as guidance to what I should continue or discontinue doing. My typical plan is this — keep pursuing new, interesting things over the year, write down accomplishments and disappointments, and look at the list at the end of the year.</p>
<p>I left my cushy job as a software engineer at Expedia to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). There were a myriad of reasons why I left:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was underpaid.</li>
<li>I wasn’t enjoying my work, and felt like I had stagnated.</li>
<li>While I loved travel, I wasn’t directly working on travel-related features (I was on a platform team).</li>
<li>Covid had caused a bust in travel and business travel industries.</li>
<li>My colleagues had left the team, and people around me were leaving (it felt akin to rats jumping off the ship).</li>
</ol>
<p>It felt like the time was right to leave. A friend had referred me to OCI, I spoke to the hiring manager and had a good impression on him and the team. I interviewed, and joined a team that owned the infrastructure to provision operating system images. It was exciting; I figured that working in the IAAS space was a good addition to my resume.</p>
<p>After a year, however, I have to say that the transition has not been smooth. The work ended up being operationally-heavy, instead of development-heavy as I was promised. Ops work took up a majority of my time. Deployments were so process-heavy that it took days to perform a small deployment. Next up was the on-call experience. It was certainly not pleasant. Engineers are to go on-call for a week every 2 months where we would be on the ‘frontlines’. This meant that if a customer was unable to start an OS of their desire at 2pm Asia time, I’d be paged and would have to look into the issue. Every time I go on-call, I’d be paged about 10 times off hours (sometimes more). Ultimately, this wore me out; I was losing plenty of sleep over that week, and it would bleed into the following weeks. I also realized that working on the low-level operating systems layer isn’t something I enjoy working on. As much as I enjoyed working with the people on the team and my manager, I felt like it wasn’t worth it.</p>
<p>A good thing about OCI is that it allows engineers to switch teams after a year; that’s what I ended up doing. I decided to switch to a new team that is more dev-heavy and have less ops work while they work on releasing a new product. Time will tell how the experience goes, but I will commit myself to it for a year before re-evaluating the situation again. Fingers crossed I’ll enjoy the work and learn a thing or two out of my time in this new team.</p>
