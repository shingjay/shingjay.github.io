At the end of the year, people typically list down their New Year’s resolutions in anticipation for the new year ahead. On the other hand, I prefer looking back at the things I’ve done over the past year. I enjoy using that as guidance to what I should continue or discontinue doing. My typical plan is this — keep pursuing new, interesting things over the year, write down accomplishments and disappointments, and look at the list at the end of the year.


I left my cushy job as a software engineer at Expedia to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). There were a myriad of reasons why I left:
1. I was underpaid.
2. I wasn’t enjoying my work, and felt like I had stagnated.
3. While I loved travel, I wasn’t directly working on travel-related features (I was on a platform team).
4. Covid had caused a bust in travel and business travel industries.
5. My colleagues had left the team, and people around me were leaving (it felt akin to rats jumping off the ship).

It felt like the time was right to leave. A friend had referred me to OCI, I spoke to the hiring manager and had a good impression on him and the team. I interviewed, and joined a team that owned the infrastructure to provision operating system images. It was exciting; I figured that working in the IAAS space was a good addition to my resume.

After a year, however, I have to say that the transition has not been smooth. The work ended up being operationally-heavy, instead of development-heavy as I was promised. Ops work took up a majority of my time. Deployments were so process-heavy that it took days to perform a small deployment. Next up was the on-call experience. It was certainly not pleasant. Engineers are to go on-call for a week every 2 months where we would be on the ‘frontlines’. This meant that if a customer was unable to start an OS of their desire at 2pm Asia time, I’d be paged and would have to look into the issue. Every time I go on-call, I’d be paged about 10 times off hours (sometimes more). Ultimately, this wore me out; I was losing plenty of sleep over that week, and it would bleed into the following weeks. I also realized that working on the low-level operating systems layer isn’t something I enjoy working on. As much as I enjoyed working with the people on the team and my manager, I felt like it wasn’t worth it.

A good thing about OCI is that it allows engineers to switch teams after a year; that’s what I ended up doing. I decided to switch to a new team that is more dev-heavy and have less ops work while they work on releasing a new product. Time will tell how the experience goes, but I will commit myself to it for a year before re-evaluating the situation again. Fingers crossed I’ll enjoy the work and learn a thing or two out of my time in this new team.
