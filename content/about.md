Hi there. My name is Jay; I am originally from Malaysia, but migrated to the US in 2009. I currently reside in Seattle and work as a software engineer in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

I practice boxing actively and teach classes at Axtion Club. Outside work and boxing, I play soccer, hike and dabble in cooking experiments.
